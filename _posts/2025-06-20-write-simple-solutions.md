title: "Write simple solutions"

Recently, I needed to switch to a new work context, stepping out of my comfort zone. Personally, I truly value these kinds of opportunities, as being exposed to new challenges and sources of knowledge is essential for growth. At the same time, it provides new insights for thoughts ans reflections as well, which one in particular I would like to share here.

As I dabbed into this new territory, everything seemed fine until I explored the new codebase I’d be working on. To put it simply, it was difficult to grasp. I’m not against complex code per se; the issue arises when the complexity outweighs the problem it addresses, and from my perspective the cost of understanding this particular codebase far exceeded the benefits it provided. I reached out to colleagues for a brief explanation, but their input didn’t clarify much. This wasn’t due to their lack of competence but rather the inherent difficulty of explaining convoluted code. If the code itself is unclear, any explanation that emerges from it is likely to be equally confusing.

Perhaps the original author, with the best intentions, over-engineered the solution because of a fear that the logic or domain might change. They may have added layers of abstraction and indirection as a precaution. However, somewhere along the way, the commitment with this goal overshadowed practicality. As programmers, we must resist the urge to be overly clever for its own sake. Instead of crafting complex solutions, we should focus on solving harder problems with simpler code. While we grow in our careers, we become adept at dealing with complexity, and may even grow comfortable with it. This comfort can mislead us into thinking complexity is inevitable or essential. Yet, beyond complexity lies a higher form of simplicity.

The most experienced programmers don’t write infinitely complex code - they create solutions that are blindingly simple.
