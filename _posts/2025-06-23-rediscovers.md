Growing up as perhaps the last generation to have a childhood without access to the internet, I clearly remember the sources of distraction we had available for fun - soccer with friends, biking, some older video games, and books. Of these that I mentioned, aside from the occasional solitary kicks I practiced in my backyard, the only fundamentally solitary enjoyment I had was reading books.

The interesting point is that this statement isn't entirely true. I always found it easy to transport myself to any world described in those pages. I still clearly remember some favorites - books that marked my life and that I revisited many times, because of the unique universe they offered when I was immersed in my reading. I’ve traveled on the Orient Express with Agatha Christie, through New York with the catcher in the rye and the Corleone family, and even through Middle-earth with Frodo Baggins and Smaug.

In particular, nighttime, right before sleep, has always been my favorite time to read. It’s a moment of comfort, where you don’t have to worry about anything - except maybe holding up a heavy book for a few hours - when all your attention can be individually dedicated to a pleasurable activity that relaxes you until sleep comes.

But life happens. The vicissitudes of daily life are always knocking at the door, and it’s up to us to deal with them in the best way possible. There was college, a period of service in the Navy, moving to a new city, a career transition... Somewhere along the way, some good habits faded just as others arrived, and unfortunately, the habit of reading was one of them.

Well, for the second time, that’s not entirely true. In reality, “faded” is too strong a word. It was still there, hidden, waiting for the right moment, which finally came. Recently, I picked up a book to read again, and about 350 pages later, I felt a familiar feeling - a relaxing emptiness that takes over my mind after finishing a few uninterrupted minutes of reading. In the midst of the everyday chaos we increasingly submit ourselves to, these moments of peace and refuge, I must confess, do wonders. I don’t know exactly the scientific or psychological explanation for this, but somehow, this peace and calm I now experience as an adult connects with the same feeling of joy I had when I was younger.

Not only from the transport and connections we make to different universes when we dedicate ourselves to reading a book, but now more than ever with the positive impacts on real life that surround this habit, I can state, categorically: it's very good to be back.
